Hello!
I am currently a fourth year PhD student at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, where I am being advised by Professor [Athina Petropulu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b6qIxrQAAAAJ&hl=el).
<br>
<br>My research interests span the areas of Deep Learning (specifically Deep Reinforcement Learning) and Signal Processing.
<br>
<br>Before my PhD studies, I worked for a couple of years as a Junior Researcher at the Institute of Communication and Computer Systems (ICCS) on topics related to Machine Learning for IoT and sensor networks.
<br>
<br>Prior to that, I completed my diploma (combined BEng and MEng) at the ECE department of the [NTUA](https://www.ntua.gr/en/schools/item/3-school-of-electrical-and-computer-engineering).
<br>
<br>I spent the summers of 2022 and 2023 as a Research Scientist Intern with the Autonomous Systems Group, at Siemens Technology where I worked on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Industrial Engineering applications.
