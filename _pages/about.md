Hello!
I am currently a PhD student at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, where I am being advised by Professor [Athina Petropulu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b6qIxrQAAAAJ&hl=el).
<br>
<br>My research interests include Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Signal Processing.
<br>
<br>Before my PhD studies, I worked as a Junior Researcher at the [Institute of Communication and Computer Systems (ICCS)](https://www.iccs.gr/en/) on projects related to Machine Learning for IoT and sensor networks.
<br>During that time, I got my MBA from the [National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ntua.gr/en/)
<br>
<br>I did my undergraduate studies at the ECE department of the [NTUA](https://www.ntua.gr/en/schools/item/3-school-of-electrical-and-computer-engineering), where I specialized on Computer Science and Machine Learning.
<br>
<br>I spent the summer of 2022 as a Research Intern at the Autonomous Systems Group, at [Siemens](https://new.siemens.com/us/en/company/siemens-in-the-usa/princeton.html) Technology, in Princeton NJ, where I was mentored by [Suat Gumussoy](https://www.gumussoy.net/). During my internship, I worked on developing Unsupervised Pretraining methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning.
